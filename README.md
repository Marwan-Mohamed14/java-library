Encapsulation → Each role (Admin, Librarian, User, Supplier) is represented as a class with specific attributes and methods.

Inheritance → Common properties shared among user roles.

Polymorphism → Role-specific behaviors when managing books or transactions.

Abstraction → High-level classes hide complex logic for file handling and stock updates.
